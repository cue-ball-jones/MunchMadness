calorie/nutritional calculator for macronutrient management


I frequently forget to eat in order to puruse work or pleasure, and I'm attempting to crack down on this mismanagement of my diet. I aim to make a simple webapp optimized for a phone that allows me to easily track my current day's caloric intake, with a breakdown by macronutrient values.

Here's what this app will do:

Show total calories

Show total grams of protein, fat, and carbs

allow for the adding of food consumed (input calorie count and nutritional gram content)

keep track of a goal, and allow the goal to be changed

Provide a percentage of total goal consumed

some sort of graph tracking progress with the percentage?

keep a streak of the number of days in a row the goal has been hit
